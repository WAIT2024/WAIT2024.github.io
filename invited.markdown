### Coinductive Reasoning in [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de)

**Speaker**: [Prof. Dmitriy Traytel](https://traytel.bitbucket.io) from the University of Copenhagen

**Abstract**: Coinductive methods are used to reason about the infinitary behavior of systems, e.g., manifested in traces of useful (potentially) non-terminating programs. Examples of such programs range from semi-decision procedures for automated theorem proving to web servers interacting with clients. In this presentation, I will survey the coinductive capabilities of the Isabelle proof assistant, with a focus on defining and reasoning about corecursive functions. In particular, I will highlight challenges for proof automation that arise in this setting.
